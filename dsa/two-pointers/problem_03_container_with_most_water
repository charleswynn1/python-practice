# You are given an array of integers height of length n.
# There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints
# of the i-th line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
#
# Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container
# that holds the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a
# container can store. Note: You may not slant the container.
#
# Example 1: Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7] Output: 49
# Explanation: The lines at index 1 (height=8) and index 8 (height=7)
# form a container. The width is 8-1=7, and the height is min(8,7)=7,
# so area = 7*7 = 49
